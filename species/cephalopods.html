      <h3>Common Octopus</h3>
      <p>The Common Octopus is one of the most widely studied and recognized species in the cephalopod family. 
        Found in tropical and temperate seas around the world, it is admired for its remarkable intelligence, problem-solving skills, and adaptability. 
        This species can rapidly change its skin color and texture to hide from predators or to communicate with other octopuses. 
        Known for being solitary hunters, they feed on crustaceans, fish, and mollusks, using their sharp beak to pierce shells. 
        Their relatively short lifespan, usually 1–2 years, is balanced by their incredible reproductive capacity

      <h3>Blue-ringed Octopus</h3>
      <p>The Blue-ringed Octopus is small in size but among the deadliest marine animals. 
        Found in shallow waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, it is famous for its striking appearance: when threatened, bright blue rings flash across its body as a warning signal. 
        Despite being only the size of a golf ball, it carries enough venom (tetrodotoxin) to paralyze and kill humans, making it both beautiful and dangerous. 
        Typically, it hides in crevices during the day and hunts small crabs and shrimp at night. </p>

      <h3>Giant Pacific Octopus</h3>
      <p>The Giant Pacific Octopus is the largest octopus species in the world, with individuals weighing over 70 kilograms and spanning more than 5 meters across. 
        Native to the cold waters of the North Pacific, from Japan to Alaska, it is a gentle giant known for its intelligence, curiosity, and adaptability. 
        Despite its size, it maintains excellent camouflage abilities, blending seamlessly into rocky seabeds. 
        Its diet includes crabs, clams, and even small sharks. With a lifespan of up to 5 years, it lives longer than most octopus species, making it a valuable subject for marine biology research.

      <h3>Humboldt Squid</h3>
      <p>The Humboldt Squid, often nicknamed the “red devil,” is a large and aggressive squid found in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. 
        Growing up to 2 meters in length, it is known for its strength, rapid color changes, and highly social hunting behavior, often forming large groups called shoals. 
        These squids are opportunistic predators, preying on fish and other squids, and are known for their occasional attacks on fishing gear and divers.

      <h3>Colossal Squid</h3>
      <p>The Colossal Squid is the heaviest and most massive cephalopod, dwelling in the deep, frigid waters of Antarctica. 
        Unlike the more famous Giant Squid, it is bulkier, with rotating hooks on its tentacles that make it a formidable predator. 
        Very little is known about its behavior due to its deep-sea habitat, but it is believed to hunt large fish such as the Patagonian toothfish. 
        With eyes measuring up to 30 centimeters across, it has the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, adapted for the pitch-black ocean depths.</p>

      <h3>The vampire squid</h3>
      <p>The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis, lit. 'vampire squid from hell') is a small
cephalopod found throughout temperate and tropical oceans in extreme deep sea
conditions. The vampire squid uses its bioluminescent organs and its unique oxygen
metabolism to thrive in the parts of the ocean with the lowest concentrations of oxygen. It
has two long retractile filaments, located between the first two pairs of arms on its dorsal
side, which distinguish it from both octopuses and squids, though its closest relatives are
octopods. As a phylogenetic relict, it is the only known surviving member of the order
Vampyromorphida.</p>

      <h3>Japanese Flying Squid</h3>
      <p>The Japanese Flying Squid is well-known in East Asia, both ecologically and economically. 
        This medium-sized squid is capable of “flying” short distances above the water surface by forcefully expelling water through its siphon, allowing it to escape predators or travel efficiently. 
        Found throughout the northern Pacific Ocean, it is also a major target for fisheries, forming the basis of squid-based cuisine in Japan and surrounding regions.</p>

      <h3>Grimpoteuthis</h3>
      <p>Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic cirrate (finned) octopods known as the dumbo
octopus. The name "dumbo" originates from their resemblance to the title character of
Disney's 1941 film Dumbo, having two prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle
above each eye. There are 17 species recognized in the genus. The Dumbo octopus
has a gelatinous body and uses fin propulsion for movement, which also helps it to conserve
energy in its extreme deep-sea environment. These unique physical traits distinguish it from
other octopuses, which primarily rely on jet propulsion. Prey include crustaceans,
bivalves, worms and copepods. The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3
to 5 years.</p>

      <h3>Common Cuttlefish</h3>
      <p>The Common Cuttlefish is one of the best-studied cuttlefish species, found in the Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. 
        It has a broad, flattened body and an internal cuttlebone, which gives it buoyancy control. 
        Known for its ability to shift through an extraordinary range of colors and patterns, it uses camouflage both for protection and to communicate during courtship. 
        It hunts small crustaceans and fish, using its specialized tentacles to strike prey with lightning speed.</p>

      <h3>Flamboyant Cuttlefish</h3>
      <p>The Flamboyant Cuttlefish is small but striking, found in shallow tropical waters around Indonesia and northern Australia. 
        Unlike most cuttlefish, it tends to walk along the sea floor using its arms rather than swimming continuously. 
        Its vibrant coloration — a dazzling mix of purples, reds, yellows, and whites — serves as a warning to predators of its toxicity. Despite its tiny size, it is considered one of the most visually stunning cephalopods.</p>
