      <h3>Stony Corals</h3>
      <p>Stony corals are the primary reef builders of the deep sea, forming massive calcium carbonate skeletons that last for centuries. 
        The most famous example is Lophelia pertusa, which creates extensive reefs in the North Atlantic, some as large as city blocks. 
        These corals grow very slowly but provide crucial habitats for fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates in the dark ocean depths. 
        Unlike shallow-water corals, they don’t rely on algae for food and instead capture plankton drifting in the currents.</p>

      <h3>Black Corals</h3>
      <p>Black corals are named for their dark, spiny skeletons rather than their living tissue, which can be white, red, yellow, or orange. 
        Found at depths from 30 to over 2,000 meters, they can grow into tree-like shapes and survive for thousands of years, making them some of the oldest living marine organisms. 
        These corals are important habitats for shrimps and crabs but are threatened by overharvesting for jewelry due to their striking skeletons. </p>

      <h3>Soft Corals</h3>
      <p>Soft corals lack rigid skeletons and instead form flexible, colorful colonies that resemble fans, plumes, or trees. 
        Among them, gorgonians are especially well-known for their spectacular fan-like structures that filter plankton from seawater. 
        The bubblegum coral (Paragorgia arborea) is a famous gorgonian that can grow several meters tall and provide shelter to countless small creatures. 
        Because of their delicate branching forms, they are highly vulnerable to damage from deep-sea trawling.

      <h3>Bamboo Corals</h3>
      <p>Bamboo corals are striking deep-sea corals with skeletons that alternate between hard calcium carbonate and flexible gorgonin, giving them the appearance of bamboo stalks. 
        They are found between 200 and 2,000 meters deep, where they form large, tree-like structures that act as nurseries for fish and invertebrates. 
        Their skeletons also serve as natural “climate recorders,” storing chemical information that helps scientists reconstruct past ocean conditions.</p>

      <h3>Sea Pens</h3>
      <p>Sea pens are elegant, feather-like corals anchored into soft sediments by a bulb-like base. 
        Unlike solitary corals, they are colonial organisms, with different polyps specialized for feeding, reproduction, and water circulation. 
        Some species glow with bioluminescence when disturbed, lighting up the seafloor in ghostly flashes. 
        They are found from shallow waters to extreme depths of 6,000 meters, making them one of the most widespread types of deep-sea corals.</p>

      <h3>Lace Corals</h3>
      <p>Snailfish (Family Liparidae) thrive from shallow waters to depths over 8,300 m, including deep ocean trenches.
        The snailfishes or sea snails (not to be confused with invertebrate sea snails), are a family of
marine ray-finned fishes. These fishes make up the Liparidae, a family classified within the
order Scorpaeniformes.[1]
Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the
snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species,[2] but there
are also many undescribed species.[3] Snailfish are found at depths ranging from shallow
coastal waters to more than 8,300 m (27,200 ft), including in seven ocean trenches.[4]
