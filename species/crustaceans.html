      <h3>Crabs</h3>
      <p>Crabs are perhaps the most recognizable crustaceans, with broad, flattened bodies and a reduced tail tucked under the thorax. 
        They walk sideways due to the alignment of their legs, and most species have one pair of powerful claws (chelae) used for defense and feeding. 
        Crabs are highly diverse, from the tiny pea crab to the massive Japanese Spider Crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), which has the longest leg span of any arthropod. 
        They live in oceans, freshwater, and even on land, playing important roles as scavengers and predators.

      <h3>Lobsters and Crayfish</h3>
      <p>Lobsters are elongated crustaceans with muscular tails and strong claws. 
        They are mainly marine species, living in burrows or crevices on the seafloor, and are prized as seafood. 
        Crayfish (or crawfish), on the other hand, are freshwater relatives of lobsters, found in rivers and lakes. 
        Both are omnivores, feeding on plants, small fish, and detritus. 
        Their large claws are used for catching food, fighting rivals, and protection from predators. </p>

      <h3>Shrimps and Prawns</h3>
      <p>Shrimps and prawns are small, slender crustaceans with long antennae and well-developed abdomens, making them excellent swimmers. 
        They form an important part of the ocean’s food chain and are also widely consumed by humans. 
        Ecologically, they act as cleaners in reefs, feeding on parasites of larger fish, while commercially, they are one of the most harvested seafoods. 
        Examples include the Cleaner Shrimp (Lysmata amboinensis), which removes parasites from reef fish, and the giant tiger prawn used in aquaculture.

      <h3>Barnacles</h3>
      <p>Barnacles are unusual crustaceans that live permanently attached to hard surfaces like rocks, ships, and even whales. 
        Unlike their free-swimming larval stage, adult barnacles are sessile, encased in a hard calcareous shell with feathery appendages (cirri) that they use to filter plankton from the water. 
        Though often considered a nuisance to ships due to biofouling, barnacles play an important ecological role as filter feeders. 
        The Goose Barnacle is one of the better-known species, with long stalks attaching them to floating debris.

      <h3>Krill</h3>
      <p>Krill are small, shrimp-like crustaceans found in enormous swarms in the world’s oceans. 
        Despite their size, they are ecologically crucial because they are the primary food source for whales, seals, penguins, and many fish species. 
        The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) forms massive populations that fuel one of the largest ecosystems on Earth. 
        Krill feed mainly on phytoplankton, transferring energy from microscopic plants to larger animals in the food web.</p>

      <h3>Isopods</h3>
      <p>Isopods are a diverse group of crustaceans that include both marine and terrestrial species. 
        Terrestrial isopods, like pill bugs or “roly-polies,” are among the few crustaceans to live entirely on land, breathing through modified gills. 
        Marine isopods range from tiny scavengers to the massive giant isopod (Bathynomus giganteus), a deep-sea species that can reach over 30 cm in length. 
        They are mostly scavengers, feeding on dead organisms that sink to the ocean floor.
