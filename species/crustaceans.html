      <h3>Anglerfish</h3>
      <p>Anglerfish (Order Lophiiformes) use a modified dorsal fin ray like a fishing rod to lure prey in the darkness of the deep sea.
        Anglerfish are ray-finned fish classified under the order Lophiiformes. They are characterized
by a modified dorsal fin ray that acts as a lure to attract prey, resembling a fishing rod. This
adaptation allows them to effectively ambush their prey in the dark depths of the ocean.

      <h3>Gulper Eel</h3>
      <p>The Gulper Eel (<i>Eurypharynx pelecanoides</i>) has a giant, hinged mouth that can swallow prey larger than itself.
      The Gulper Eel, scientifically known as Eurypharynx pelecanoides, is a deep-sea fish notable
for its enormous mouth and unique feeding adaptations. Physical Characteristics The Gulper
Eel is easily recognized by its disproportionately large mouth, which can open wide enough
to swallow prey much larger than itself. This mouth is loosely hinged, allowing it to capture
large meals effectively. </p>

      <h3>Viperfish</h3>
      <p>Viperfish (<i>Chauliodus</i>) live in the mesopelagic zone, known for their needle-like teeth and bioluminescence.
      A viperfish is any species of marine fish in the genus Chauliodus. Viperfish are mostly found
in the mesopelagic zone and are characterized by long, needle-like teeth and hinged lower
jaws. A typical viperfish grows to lengths of 30 cm (12 in). Viperfishes undergo diel vertical
migration and are found all around the world in tropical and temperate oceans. Viperfishes
are capable of bioluminescence and possess photophores along the ventral side of their
body, likely used to camouflage them by blending in with the less than 1% of light that
reaches to below 200 meters depth.

      <h3>Lanternfish</h3>
      <p>Lanternfish (Family Myctophidae) are small but extremely abundant, making up to 65% of deep-sea fish biomass.
        Lanternfish (or myctophids, from the Greek μυκτήρ myktḗr, "nose" and ophis, "serpent") are
small mesopelagic fish of the large family Myctophidae. One of two families in the order
Myctophiformes, the Myctophidae are represented by 246 species in 33 genera, and are
found in oceans worldwide. They are named after their conspicuous use of bioluminescence.
Their sister family, the Neoscopelidae, are much fewer in number but superficially very
similar; at least one neoscopelid shares the common name "lanternfish": the large-scaled
lantern fish, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus.
Lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, diverse and populous vertebrates, with
some estimates suggesting that they may have a total global biomass of 1.8 to 16
gigatonnes, accounting for up to 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Commercial fisheries for
them exist off South Africa, in the sub-Antarctic, and in the Gulf of Oman.

      <h3>Stomiidae</h3>
      <p>Stomiidae is a family of deep-sea ray-finned fish, including the barbeled dragonfishes, that
live in all oceans in a wide range of depths. They are quite small, usually around 15 cm, up to
26 cm, and they exhibit a strong sexual dimorphism. These fish are apex predators and have
enormous jaws filled with fang-like teeth.[1] They are also able to hinge the neurocranium
and upper-jaw system, which leads to the opening of the jaw to more than 100 degrees.[1]
This ability allows them to consume extremely large prey, often 50% greater than their
standard length.[1]</p>

      <h3>Snailfish</h3>
      <p>Snailfish (Family Liparidae) thrive from shallow waters to depths over 8,300 m, including deep ocean trenches.
        The snailfishes or sea snails (not to be confused with invertebrate sea snails), are a family of
marine ray-finned fishes. These fishes make up the Liparidae, a family classified within the
order Scorpaeniformes.[1]
Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the
snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species,[2] but there
are also many undescribed species.[3] Snailfish are found at depths ranging from shallow
coastal waters to more than 8,300 m (27,200 ft), including in seven ocean trenches.[4]
