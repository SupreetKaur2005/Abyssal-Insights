      <h3>Sac Fungi</h3>
      <p>Ascomycota are the most abundant deep-sea fungi.
        They reproduce using microscopic sac-like structures called asci that contain spores.
        These fungi thrive in sediments, decaying organic matter, and inside deep-sea sponges.
        Many produce unusual secondary metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer properties, making them important for drug discovery.
        Examples include Aspergillus and Penicillium species isolated from deep waters.</p>

      <h3>Club Fungi</h3>
      <p>Basidiomycota are less common in the deep sea but are still important.
        They reproduce with basidiospores formed on club-shaped structures called basidia.
        In the ocean, they are often found in association with decaying wood that has drifted into deep waters or in sediments.
        Some species can break down tough plant material like lignin, making them crucial decomposers.
        Their unique enzymes are studied for applications in biofuel and waste degradation. </p>

      <h3>Zygomycota</h3>
      <p>These fungi are known for their ability to form zygospores, thick-walled resistant spores that can survive extreme pressure and nutrient-poor conditions.
        In the deep sea, they colonize organic particles and sediments, breaking down carbohydrates and proteins.
        Some zygomycetes also show symbiotic behavior, living alongside bacteria to aid in survival under extreme stress.

      <h3>Chytridiomycota</h3>
      <p>Chytrids are simple, microscopic fungi that have flagellated spores, making them unique among fungi for being motile.
        In the deep sea, chytrids often parasitize algae or detrital matter, helping regulate microbial communities.
        Some thrive on decaying phytoplankton that sink from surface waters, acting as recyclers of carbon and nutrients in the deep ocean ecosystem.</p>

      <h3>Glomeromycota</h3>
      <p>Though primarily known from terrestrial environments, some glomeromycetes are reported from marine sediments.
        They form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, possibly with deep-sea plants (seagrasses in shallower zones) or microbes.
        Their role in the deep sea is less studied, but they may assist in nutrient exchange within sediments and hydrothermal vent ecosystems.</p>

      <h3>Snailfish</h3>
      <p>Snailfish (Family Liparidae) thrive from shallow waters to depths over 8,300 m, including deep ocean trenches.
        The snailfishes or sea snails (not to be confused with invertebrate sea snails), are a family of
marine ray-finned fishes. These fishes make up the Liparidae, a family classified within the
order Scorpaeniformes.[1]
Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the
snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species,[2] but there
are also many undescribed species.[3] Snailfish are found at depths ranging from shallow
coastal waters to more than 8,300 m (27,200 ft), including in seven ocean trenches.[4]
