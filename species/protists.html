      <h3>Protozoa (Animal-like Protists)</h3>
      <p>
Protozoa are unicellular, heterotrophic protists that move using cilia, flagella, or pseudopodia. They often resemble tiny animals in behavior and nutrition, feeding on bacteria, algae, or other small organisms. Protozoa include species like:
<br><br>
<strong>Amoeba:</strong> Moves via pseudopodia and engulfs food by phagocytosis.
<br>
<strong>Paramecium:</strong> Covered in cilia, it sweeps food into its oral groove and has a contractile vacuole for water balance.
<br>
<strong>Plasmodium:</strong> A parasitic protozoan responsible for malaria, transmitted via mosquitoes.

      <h3>Algae (Plant-like Protists)</h3>
      <p>
Algae are mostly autotrophic protists that perform photosynthesis using chlorophyll. They range from unicellular microalgae to large multicellular forms like seaweeds. Algae produce a significant portion of Earth’s oxygen and are vital primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Examples include:
<br><br>
<strong>Chlorella:</strong> Unicellular green algae used in research and as a health supplement.
<br>
<strong>Spirogyra:</strong> Filamentous green algae with spiral chloroplasts, commonly found in freshwater.
<br>
<strong>Brown algae (Phaeophyceae):</strong> Multicellular, like kelp, forming underwater forests.

      <h3>Slime Molds (Fungus-like Protists)</h3>
      <p>
Slime molds have characteristics of both fungi and protozoa. They can exist as amoeboid cells feeding on bacteria or aggregate into multicellular reproductive structures under stress. They thrive in moist, decaying matter and are studied for their unusual movement and problem-solving behavior. Examples:
<br><br>
<strong>Physarum polycephalum:</strong> Famous for forming networks to find food efficiently, even in mazes.

      <h3>Water Molds (Oomycetes)</h3>
      <p>
Water molds are fungus-like protists that live in water or damp environments and often act as decomposers or parasites. 
They were once classified as fungi but differ in cell wall composition (cellulose instead of chitin). 
Some water molds are economically important due to their role in plant diseases. Examples:
<br><br>
<strong>Phytophthora infestans:</strong> Caused the Irish Potato Famine by attacking potato crops.
<br>
<strong>Saprolegnia:</strong> Common in freshwater, parasitizing fish or decaying matter.

      <h3>Euglenoids (Mixotrophic Protists)</h3>
      <p>
Euglenoids are unique protists that can act as autotrophs when sunlight is available and as heterotrophs when it is not, demonstrating mixotrophy. They have a flexible pellicle instead of a rigid cell wall and a whip-like flagellum for movement. Examples:
<br><br>
<strong>Euglena:</strong> A well-studied organism in biology, capable of photosynthesis and consuming organic matter.

    <div class="species-text">
      <h3>Dinoflagellates (Flagellated Protists)</h3>
      <p>
Dinoflagellates are mostly marine protists with two flagella that enable spinning movements. Many are photosynthetic and form the base of ocean food webs, but some produce toxins causing red tides. Examples include:
<br><br>
<strong>Noctiluca scintillans:</strong> A bioluminescent dinoflagellate that glows at night in coastal waters.
<br>
<strong>Gonyaulax:</strong> Produces toxins during harmful algal blooms.
